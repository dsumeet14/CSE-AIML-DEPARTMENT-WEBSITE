                        The Government of India on the recommendations of the University Grants Commission conferred the status of “Deemed to be University” initially on a cluster of twelve Institutions of Bharati Vidyapeeth. Subsequently, that number got increased. 
                        The University started functioning on 26th April, 1996. 
                        Now there are twenty nine constituent units of this University which include colleges of various conventional and emerging disciplines.<br><br>
                        
                        One of the distinguishing features of this University is three Research Institutes which it runs with its own funding:<br><br>
                        
                        Interactive Research School for Health Affairs (IRSHA)
                        Research and Development Centre in Pharmaceutical Sciences and Applied Chemistry
                        Yashwantrao Chavan Institute of Social Science Studies and Research<br><br>

                        The constituent units of the University are located in Delhi, Pune, Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Solapur, Sangli and Karad.<br><br>
                        
                        During the last twenty years or so, the University has established its academic reputation to such an extent that it attracts students not only from different parts of India but also from abroad.

                        The publication track record of the faculty is very commendable. 
                        During the last five years or so, they have published 573 research based articles in national and 798 in international journals. 
                        Besides they have also obtained more than 25 patents for their research products.<br><br>
                        
                        The high degree of academic excellence which the University has achieved is highlighted by the fact that the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) has awarded prestigious ‘A’ grade to it consecutively twice, firstly in 2004 and then in 2011 and A+ in 2017.<br><br>
